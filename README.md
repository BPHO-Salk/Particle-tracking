# Batch particle tracking for time-lapse live cell images

This script works independently from Imaris as an Imaris extention. It 
requires the user to have a good level of familiarity with Imaris.
This script is used for particle tracking of live cell images.

## Notes:
  - Input: time-lapse 2D/3D single channel images.
  - Users need to modify parameters in section "Create spots" according
    to their own needs.
  - Object-related, track-related and overall stats are saved separately. 

## Preconditions:
  - ImarisLib.jar (which normally locates in the XTensions folder in the
    Imaris installation directory) needs to be put in the same folder.
  - Imaris needs to be running when executing the following code.
